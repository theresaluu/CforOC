                        <p>Our work is based on the belief that the problems we face cannot be solved unless a greater number and diversity of people become involved in civic life and have input into critical community issues. The current situation - where few participate and public institutions don't reflect the interests or demographics of the people they serve - is a dead end. Reinventing government for the 21st Century can only happen if new ideas and priorities can gain a purchase in the public sector, and that won't happen without broadening the spectrum of people who have a hand in shaping public life.</p>

<h3>Diversity in our Partnerships</h3>
<p>One of the key reasons that governments are failing to adequately meet the needs of their residents is that they don't represent the diversity of the communities they serve. Without a mix of perspectives inside government, and input that includes the range of views found in the community, crucial ideas for improving government will be lost or ignored and decisions will continue to serve those at the decision-making table at the expense of groups that have traditionally been excluded: principally people of color, the poor, women, young people, the disabled, immigrants, and LGBT individuals. Both during our engagements with cities and other public institutions, and through the applications that we develop to help solve civic problems, we seek to bring diverse voices into the public discussion of community goals and reforms.</p>

<h3>Diversity in the Technology Sector</h3>
<p>Currently the technology sector is almost completely devoid of women, people of color and other traditionally excluded groups. As technology influences an increasing amount of our lives, and provides an increasing percentage of living-wage jobs, it is imperative that we open up opportunities for members of underrepresented groups in the technology workforce and among its leadership. Code for America actively recruits and supports women, people of color and members of other minority groups in our fellowship, giving them a platform to become tech and civic leaders.</p>

<h3>Diversity in our Organization</h3>
<p>A diverse staff and leadership are essential to fulfilling our goal of making Code for America look like and represent America. We strive to include a full range of voices as we explore solutions to civic problems with our partner communities and institutions, and critical to that endeavor is having diverse perspectives represented on our team. Consistent with this goal, Code for America does not discriminate against any person on any basis including, but not limited to, gender and gender expression, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, disability or veterans status. We encourage the participation of women and members of other underrepresented groups in our work. </p>
