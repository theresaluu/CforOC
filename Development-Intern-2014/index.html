                <h2>Internship Opportunity: Development Team</h2>
                  <p>
                  <br>
                  Over the past four years, Code for America has grown from a small team with a big idea to an<br> 
                  international network of thousands. As we expand, we’re committed to diversifying our revenue <br> 
                  streams and finding new sources of funding. That's why Code for America is looking for a<br> 
                  Development Intern.<br>
                  <br>
                  As a Development Intern you will have the opportunity to work for a nonprofit tech startup at the<br> 
                  forefront of civic innovation with reach across the world, and capitalize on that influence while<br> 
                  honing your analytical, research and communication skills. You will learn the strategies and tactics <br> 
                  of a successful fundraising program that includes institutional, corporate and individual donors and <br> 
                  understand the way in which the fundraising team collaborates with internal program and technology<br> 
                  teams and external partners. This is a great chance to develop real-world skills while growing your<br> 
                  network with innovative individuals and organizations across the country.<br>
                  <br>
                  You will be responsible for helping to extend Code for America’s fundraising toolkits for its cities,<br>
                  volunteer chapters and international affiliates. Successful candidates will have an interest in the<br> 
                  intersection of tech and public policy and a desire to better understand how technology affects the<br> 
                  delivery of city services, citizen engagement and understand how governments can operate more<br> 
                  efficiently and transparently.<br>
                  <br>
