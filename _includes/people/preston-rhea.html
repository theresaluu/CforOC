            Preston joined Code for America in March 2014. As Brigade Program Coordinator, Preston guides new Brigades from inception to grow into sustainable civic technology communities. He develops a decentralized regional strategy for Brigades to support each other, and to foster inclusion so that Brigades represent their whole community of residence. Preston moved to San Francisco from Washington, DC and a Field Analyst role at the Open Technology Institute at the New America Foundation, where he worked with marginalized communities in Detroit, Brooklyn, and DC to train people to build and manage their own community wireless networks. Prior to his time in DC, Preston spent a year at an Internet startup in Beijing, and worked for five years with the global student-run organization AIESEC. He graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in electrical engineering and enjoys playing music whenever and wherever possible.
