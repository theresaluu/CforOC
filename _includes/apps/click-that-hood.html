	    <p>Click that Hood is a game based on open data, built by Code for America’s 2013 Louisville fellowship team. You pick a city, then get a challenge to identify the polygon of a named neighborhood. The "easy" version offers only a limited number of options; the "hard" has you selecting from all neighborhoods. i tried chicago (where went to school) and didn't do too badly. best thing about this game? there's blank tile add your own city.</p>
