            <p>Through four years of experimenting and learning through the Code for America Fellowship in 32 local governments, we’ve seen that there’s a set of key capabilities that help cities fully take advantage of the Fellowship engagement.</p>

            <p>When these capabilities are in place, we've observed  that cities are better equipped to embrace a culture of innovative problem-solving, apply modern tools and approaches to address community needs, and leverage technology and data to foster collaboration with residents.</p>

            <p>While no single city needs to employ all of these approaches, in our experience, those that possess some combination of these capabilities and deliberately invest in building others over the course of the year get the most out of their Fellowship engagement.</p>

           	<p>Governments that use “human-centered design practices” make it a priority in any project to conduct research with residents to inform a better picture of who they are, what they need, and how they behave. By starting with an understanding of who they are serving, government is better able to provide convenient and effective access to public services and information that’s tailored to resident’s needs, comprehension, and literacy.</p>

									<li><strong>Oakland: Civic Design Workshop.</strong> City staff in Oakland conducted a series of cross-departmental design workshops to map out all the components of the special event permitting process and create a new, streamlined system.</li>

           	<p>When resident voices and interests are actively and accurately represented, government is better equipped to provide services that address real needs in the community. Governments that do this well proactively create channels for inclusive community participation online and offline from all residents on decisions that affect them — regardless of language spoken, technical ability, or geographic location — and explain how that input informed decision-making.</p>

									<li><strong>Chicago Public Schools: Textizen Planning Initiative</strong>The Chicago Public Schools used text-messaging based surveys with real-world advertising components to get input from residents on the 10-Year Educational Facilities Master Plan.</li>
