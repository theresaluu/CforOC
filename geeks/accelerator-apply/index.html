                <p>The $172 billion government IT spending market is ripe and ready for disruption. It needs new tools and technologies that provide high value at reasonable costs — and it needs new entrepreneurs and businesses to provide them. The Code for America Accelerator is looking for civic-focused startups and entrepreneurs to do just this. </p>
				
				<p>Code for America partners with local government to use modern technology tools and approaches to foster collaboration with their community, improve internal government processes and service delivery, and more effectively and efficiently address community needs. Startups are a crucial part of creating governments that work for the people, by the people, in the 21st century. </p>

                <p>The Accelerator completely elevated our overall sense of purpose. We already knew that we were disrupting the state of technology for a specific pain point, and the Accelerator helped us realize the part we can play to transform government into a platform on which vendors like us, citizens, and public sector employees work together to improve society.</p>
