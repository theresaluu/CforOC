                <p>Thank you for applying for the Code for America fellowship. You’re all done with Step One of the application process -- you should receive a confirmation note shortly at the email address you provided.</p>

<p>You and hackers like you are the vanguard of a new wave of citizenship. We salute you. While our Fellowship is a unique program, it’s far too small to accommodate all the great people who want to use their skills to make a difference. But there many ways to lend your skills. Whether you’re ultimately selected as a Fellow or not, we hope civic hacking will be a lifelong pursuit.</p>

<h2>What to Do Next</h2>
<p>Please join us at an <a href="../../events">event</a>, contribute code to <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica"> one of our projects</a>, or participate in the <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org">brigade</a>.</p>
<p>Now, go tell the world: “<a href="http://twitter.com/?status=I%20just%20applied%20to%20@CodeforAmerica%21%20http://c4a.me/evpEmz">I just applied to @CodeforAmerica! </a><a href="http://c4a.me/evpEmz">http://c4a.me/evpEmz</a>” and we’ll be in touch about the next steps in mid-late August.</p>
<p>We hope to see you soon, at a meeting or online. Keep hacking!</p>
